  <p class="intro">
    That&rsquo;s me, the guy publishing this site. Hi.
  </p>
</div>

I use Warpspire to collect interesting links, publish opinions, and review software / games / books. I try to keep the site focused on technology-focused product design and it's impact on this world. But sometimes I just publish things that pique my interest. If you're looking to get started, here's some of my favorite articles:

* [Pixels don't care](/posts/pixels-dont-care/)
* [Designing GitHub for Mac](/posts/designing-github-mac/)
* [Product design at GitHub](http://warpspire.com/posts/product-design/)

## About me

I'm pretty critical of software.
I think software should be enjoyable to use and affect the world in a positive manner.
That's unfortunately not quite the world we live in.
But I still deeply love software — I think it's one of the most powerful inventions of humankind.
And I can't help think that we could do so much more if we held ourselves to higher standards.

I'm a bit of a hippie, a bit of a capitalist, and a hyperbolic crazy person in between.
But you know, maybe that's just the side effects of working in software for this long.

I've been designing things for the internet since 1997.
For years I was a tinkerer, building web sites for games I loved. I tinkered with static sites, blogs, themes, ([Hemingway](https://github.com/kneath/hemingway)), forums, community sites (Drum Report, Total Spore, Poetry With Meaning), and even building my [own game](https://github.com/kneath/nightfire).
In 2007, when I completed my degree in Civil Engineering, I decided to take my part time job at [Web Associates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEVEL_Studios) full time and dive into technology for my career.
I worked on big-name brands for a while until I left to join [ENTP](http://entp.com/) where among other things, I designed [Tender](http://tenderapp.com/).
In 2009, I joined [GitHub](https://github.com) where, until 2014, I was head of product, growing github.com to over a million active users, and revenues by a factor of 50.

For now, I'm back to tinkering while I spend some time with my Dad, enjoying the mountains in Dunsmuir, CA.
