# My Projects

I spend a lot of time fooling around with new design techniques and writing a lot of really crappy code that probably doesn't work.

## [kneath on GitHub](http://github.com/kneath)

It should be no suprise that I'm all about the GitHubs. You can find a lot of crazy projects here. Everything from [TextMate snippets](http://github.com/kneath/textmate-snippets) to [crazy Sinatra+MongoDB+Mustache toy apps](http://github.com/kneath/watchtower) to [insane ramblings not good enough to post here](http://github.com/kneath/notebook).

## [kneath on dribbble](http://dribbble.com/players/kneath)

I kind of have a huge crush on [dribbble](http://dribbble.com). Because it's amazing. I post lots of my 2am caffeine fueled Photoshop sessions there along with a good mix of upcoming stuff from [work](http://github.com).

<div id="dribbble"></div>
<script src="/js/halfcourt.js" type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">var hcs = new HalfCourtShot({ jersey: "kneath", shots: 4, goal: 'dribbble' });</script>

## [Hemingway](/hemingway)

Hemingway is a blog theme written primarily for WordPress.  There hasn't been much of any work on this since I first created it â€” but I'm always [accepting patches](http://github.com/kneath/hemingway)
