    That&rsquo;s me, the guy publishing this site. Hi.
  </p>
</div>


I use Warpspire to collect interesting links, publish opinions, and review software / games / books. I try to keep the site focused on technology-focused product design and it's impact on this world. But sometimes I just publish things that pique my interest. If you're looking to get started, here's some of my favorite articles:

* [Pixels don't care](/posts/pixels-dont-care/)
* [Designing GitHub for Mac](/posts/designing-github-mac/)
* [Product design at GitHub](http://warpspire.com/posts/product-design/)

## About me

I've been designing things for the internet since 1997.
For years I was a tinkerer, building web sites for games I loved. I tinkered with static sites, blogs, themes, ([Hemingway](https://github.com/kneath/hemingway)), forums, community sites (Total Spore, Poetry With Meaning), and even building my [own game](https://github.com/kneath/nightfire).
In 2007, when I completed my degree in Civil Engineering, I decided to take my part time job at [Web Associates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEVEL_Studios) full time and dive into technology for my career.
I worked on big-name brands for a while until I left to join [ENTP](http://entp.com/) and eventually design [Tender](http://tenderapp.com/).
In 2009, I joined [GitHub](https://github.com) where, until 2014, I was head of product, growing github.com to over a million active users, and revenues by a factor of 50.
For now, I'm back to tinkering while I spend some time with my Dad, enjoying life in Dunsmuir, CA.
