In a lot of ways, I've been writing this post in my head for the past four years.  Starting in April, I'm leaving [Web Associates](http://webassociates.com).  In doing so I'll be joining up with the ranks of [ENTP](http://entp.com) and also starting up my own little thingy (hell if I know what to call it), [Helvetino](http://helvetino.com).

## ENTP

I can't tell you how incredibly stoked I am to be joining up with the rockstars at ENTP. The team is made up of the most skilled people I've ever known in my life, and they make products that I *actually* use every day.  Best of all, everyone over there has the same crazy idea-driven mindset that I do, **and** the skillset to pull it off.

## Helvetino

Helvetino is going to be my official front-end to all these random projects I've had tumbling around in my head for years.  Sites like [Poetry with meaning](http://poetrywithmeaning.com), [Total Spore](http://totalspore.com) will be immediately joining the ranks, and sites like [Drum Report](http://drumreport.com), [The Hostr](http://thehostr.com) will be joining soon after.  It means that I'll be taking all of these side projects seriously and finally give them the love and attention they deserve.

## Learning and giving back

One of the strongest driving factors in this move in my life is just the quench for *more time*.  I want to have time to sit back and just *learn Actionscript*, or just *release a new project*.  I haven't had that so far in my life -- work or college has always taken up all of my time.  Any learning time was the time after work that was already split between my projects and friends.

This move is going to give me much more time to work on the things I've always wanted. I'll be able to learn new technologies and techniques *right* -- the first time.  Most importantly I'll have time to give back to the communities that have made my job so enjoyable.

In short: keep an eye on my little [github universe](http://github.com/kneath) -- good things are coming.

## Warpspire

The third leg of this move is of course Warpspire. For the longest time Warpspire has fallen silent compared to the glory days of old.  I'll hope to have time to start updating Warpspire regularly now.  I've never had a shortage of ideas for content here, I've just had a shortage of time to craft those ideas into coherent paragraphs.  I looked at the drafts collection in my Wordpress dashboard and found that I had a draft from *2005* -- almost three years old!  No more will that happen -- I hope to establish some sort of regular publication schedule, and maybe even finish the site some time (*cough* lifestream *cough*).

## Web Associates

I do want to point out here that my choice to move on had little to do with WA in particular.  WA has given me amazing opportunities in the past three and a half years.  I'm 23 years old and I've lead projects that have served millions of users and shipped on millions of machines.  Come this time next year, I'll be able to walk into nearly any computer retailer and see my product on their LCD's.  I can't even describe how amazing the projects and people I've gotten to work with have been.  They're a stellar company with a track record of excellence, an amazing culture, and have some of the lowest average work weeks I've ever seen in an agency (this is a pretty amazing thing -- finding an agency with even a <50hr/wk average is uncommon).  If you're looking for a job, I'd seriously look at WA.

My decision to move on was spawned primarily by my craving to screw up my life -- umm, I mean, take chances.  When I graduated in June (2007), I transitioned straight into full time with WA, which was pretty much a dream job for me at the time.  But in many ways it was the safe road, and allowed me very little time to exercise my crazy ideas I have bouncing around in my head.

So here we are -- the dawning of a new day. Are you excited? I sure as hell am!
