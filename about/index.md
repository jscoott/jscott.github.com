# Kyle Neath

<p class="intro">
  My name is Kyle Neath and I work at <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> in San Francisco. I love to build beautiful things with software.

Warpspire is the place that I post my thoughts on technology, product, and anything else that piques my interest. If you're looking to get started, here's some of my favorite articles:

* [Pixels don't care](/posts/pixels-dont-care/)
* [Designing GitHub for Mac](/posts/designing-github-mac/)
* [Product design at GitHub](http://warpspire.com/posts/product-design/)

I believe software will effect a Change in this world (and beyond), and I want to be part of it. I'm not a designer. Not a programmer. Not a manager. **I build things with software.** I went to school for [Civil Engineering](http://assets.warpspire.com/images/site/degree.jpg), but ended up in software instead.

I work on product at GitHub. We're creating a better way to design, build, and ship software.
